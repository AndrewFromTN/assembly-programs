# Assembly Programs

## What is this?
These programs were written for my computer organization and assembly language programming course. There are some missing files with the assembler so they likely won't assemble.

* Plane Line - Calculates plane line intersection point
* Vankin's Mile - Solves the best outcome for a Vankin's mile problem
* Interpolating Polynomials - Calculate an interpolation point for a given polynomial using Newton's method.
* Fallout - Solve the guessing game from the Fallout video game
* Interrupts - Used dosbox to set a custom interupt handler. Also includes a F->C and C->F converter.
